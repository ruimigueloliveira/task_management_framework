# task_management_framework
The objective of the work is developing a framework (Task Manager â€“ TMan) that allows registering a  set of FreeRTOS tasks, associate each task with a set of attributes (e.g. period, deadline, phase,  precedence constraints) and activate those tasks at the appropriate instants.
